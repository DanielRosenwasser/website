# jetson.sh website

This is production repo for the `jetson.sh` website, hosted on Netlify.

The Jekyll theme and all subdomains that use it are in this repo, to easily facilitate cross-site changes.

To test one of the subdomains, run a Jekyll server from its directory. For example:

```sh
cd subdomains/www
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
